done
project manager would be fine
8 hours is accepted.
i accept 10 hours with slow promotion track
fast track promotion is fine
we can offer the 20% pension , but that means no car allowance.
you need to be a programmer job title
agreed
no leased car. use your own car.
will you accept 7000 ?
a leased car is not needed in this position
then we can not agree on the salary
that sounds fair.
i offered 12000 for 9 hours or 10 hours for 20000 . those are my final offers.
will you accept 7000 ?
i am prepared to offer you a position as a programmer at this time
no need for a leased car in this position

i am unable to accept fast promotion track
